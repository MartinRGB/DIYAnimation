/// `Transaction` is the mechanism for batching multiple layer-tree operations
/// into atomic updates to the render tree. Every modification to a layer tree
/// must be part of a transaction. Nested transactions are supported.
///
/// There are two types of transactions: implicit transactions and explicit
/// transactions. Implicit transactions are created automatically when the layer
/// tree is modified by a thread without an active transaction and are committed
/// automatically when the thread's runloop next iterates. Explicit transactions
/// occur when the the application sends the `Transaction` class a `begin()`
/// message before modifying the layer tree, and a `commit()` message afterwards.
///
/// `Transaction` allows you to override default animation properties that are
/// set for animatable properties. You can customize duration, timing function,
/// whether changes to properties trigger animations, and provide a handler that
/// informs you when all animations from the transaction group are completed.
///
/// During a transaction you can temporarily acquire a recursive spin lock for
/// managing property atomicity.
